Your team has been tasked with developing a system that can automatically generate informative responses to common patient questions about medical conditions, treatments, and wellness practices.\n",

    "The challenge is to ensure these responses are both accurate and grounded in authoritative medical information. Your specific assignment is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can:\n",

Before answering, it queries an external knowledge source (for example a database or document collection) and retrieves the most relevant passages. The model then conditions its response on this fresh, context-specific information. This reduces hallucination, grounds outputs in verifiable sources, and allows updates without retraining the model."
